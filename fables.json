{"A rich nobleman once opened the theaters without charge to the people,":"and gave a public notice that he would handsomely reward any person"},
{"the populace for his jokes, and said that he had a kind of entertainment":"which had never been brought out on any stage before. This report"},
{"being spread about made a great stir, and the theater was crowded":"in every part. The Buffoon appeared alone upon the platform, without"},
{"any apparatus or confederates, and the very sense of expectation caused":"an intense silence. He suddenly bent his head towards his bosom and"},
{"imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably with his voice":"that the audience declared he had a porker under his cloak, and demanded"},
{"A Countryman in the crowd, observing all that has passed, said, "So":"help me, Hercules, he shall not beat me at that trick!' and at once"},
{"proclaimed that he would do the same thing on the next day, though":"in a much more natural way. On the morrow a still larger crowd assembled"},
{"in the theater, but now partiality for their favorite actor very generally":"prevailed, and the audience came rather to ridicule the Countryman"},
{"Next the Countryman commenced, and pretending that he concealed a":"little pig beneath his clothes (which in truth he did, but not suspected"},
{"by the audience ) contrived to take hold of and to pull his ear causing":"the pig to squeak. The Crowd, however, cried out with one consent"},
{"that the Buffoon had given a far more exact imitation, and clamored":"for the Countryman to be kicked out of the theater. On this the rustic"},
{"produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by the most positive":"proof the greatness of their mistake. 'Look here,' he said, 'this"},

{"through a lying dream of my father's, which he saw in his sleep, I":"am shut up on your account in this palace as if I had been a girl:"},
{"what shall I now do to you?' With these words he stretched out his":"hands toward a thorn-tree, meaning to cut a stick from its branches"},
{"his finger and caused great pain and inflammation, so that the young":"Prince fell down in a fainting fit. A violent fever suddenly set in,"},
{"The Cat and Venus":"A Cat fell in love with a handsome young man, and entreated Venus"},
{"and transformed her into a beautiful damsel, so that the youth saw":"her and loved her, and took her home as his bride. While the two were"},

{"The She-Goats and Their Beards":"The She-Goats having obtained a beard by request to Jupiter, the He-Goats"},

{"quickly made his son mount the Ass, and continued to walk along merrily":"by his side. Presently they came up to a group of old men in earnest"},
{"What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle":"lad riding while his old father has to walk? Get down, you young scapegrace,"},
{"proceeded far when they met a company of women and children: "Why,":"you lazy old fellow,' cried several tongues at once, 'how can you"},
{"ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep":"pace by the side of you?' The good-natured Miller immediately took"},

{"of the Ass together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry":"him on their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town."},
{"This entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it,":"till the Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he"},
{"was subject to, broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the":"pole, fell into the river. Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed,"},

{"when he had recruited his feeble strength, freed himself with a sudden":"bound from the pit, and hastened to his den with rapid steps. After"},
